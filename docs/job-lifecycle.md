# CimaSim Fixed-Template Job Lifecycle

This phase implements an internal file spool for one authorized template:
`rc_lowpass_fixed_v1`. It does not accept user netlists, model files,
parameters, sweeps, cancellation, deletion, Redis, PostgreSQL, or parallel
workers.

The preview Nginx configuration exposes only the exact authenticated job and
waveform routes. The frontend does not call them yet; authenticated manual
validation uses same-origin requests from the browser console.

## Spool Layout

```text
/spool/
├── queued/
├── claimed/
├── jobs/
│   └── <job_id>/
│       ├── request.json
│       ├── status.json
│       ├── summary.json
│       └── artifacts/
│           └── waveform.csv
└── failed/
```

`job_id` is generated only by the backend. Clients cannot supply it. JSON files
are written with a temporary file, fsync, and atomic replace. The backend and
worker reject symlinks, non-regular files, corrupt JSON, unsupported fields, and
paths supplied inside JSON.

## States

- `queued`: accepted by the backend and represented by a marker in `queued/`.
- `running`: claimed by the worker via atomic rename into `claimed/`.
- `succeeded`: Xyce completed and `waveform.csv` plus `summary.json` validated.
- `failed`: validation, execution, artifact collection, or recovery failed.
- `timed_out`: Xyce exceeded the fixed timeout and the process group was stopped.

Terminal states are immutable: `succeeded`, `failed`, and `timed_out`.

## Valid Transitions

| From | To | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| none | `queued` | Backend accepts a fixed-template request. |
| `queued` | `running` | Worker atomically claims the marker. |
| `running` | `succeeded` | Xyce output validates successfully. |
| `running` | `failed` | Xyce exits non-zero, output validation fails, or artifact collection fails. |
| `running` | `timed_out` | Xyce exceeds the fixed timeout. |

There is no retry in this phase. A failed or timed-out job remains terminal.

## Recovery

On startup the worker inspects `claimed/`. Abandoned jobs are not silently
returned to `queued` and are not executed a second time. The worker marks them
`failed` with reason `worker_restarted` and preserves existing terminal results.

## Artifact Rules

Only `waveform.csv` may be exposed. It must be a regular file, not a symlink, no
larger than 5 MiB, and owned through the job's validated `user_id`. API responses
use `Cache-Control: no-store` and never expose internal paths, hostnames, stdout,
environment variables, or netlist content.

## Current deployment boundary

Backend UID `10001` and worker UID `10002` share only the named CimaSim spool
through supplemental GID `10003`. The single worker has no network or ports.
Cancellation, retention automation, Redis/PostgreSQL, arbitrary inputs, and
multiworker scheduling remain future work.
